# What is this?
This is a project that I code in python that uses the CIA Triad concept.

The CIA Triad is a fundamental concept in information security that stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three principles are essential to ensure the protection of sensitive information and assets.

# Summary of the Code:
This program uses the hashlib library to generate a SHA-256 hash of the input data. The hash is then returned by the confidentiality method, providing a way to protect the data's confidentiality.

The integrity method also generates a SHA-256 hash of the data. However, this hash is not used to protect the data's confidentiality. Instead, it is used to verify the data's integrity. If the data has been tampered with, the hash generated by the integrity method will not match the original hash generated by the __init__ method, indicating that the data has been altered.

Finally, the availability method returns the length of the input data. This is a simple way to measure the availability of the data. If the data is not available (e.g., if it has been lost or destroyed), the availability method will return a value of zero.

Overall, this program demonstrates how the CIA Triad concept can be implemented in a simple Python program. By using the hashlib library, it provides a way to protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information, while also measuring its availability.
